# TypeScript Chess

TypeScript DevLabs Day 3

## Introduction

This is an opportunity to explore all of the new class based syntax that TypeScript provides!

## Task

Build a Chess engine using Classes.

You will need to have a class that represents each piece on the board.

Each piece needs a way to know it's position on the board

## Learning Objectives

- Use an Abstract Class
- Use access modifiers (e.g. public)
- Use Interfaces to design shapes of classes
